# Maze-Game-with-Monsters
In this project, it will be tried to find the way out without being caught by monsters in a labyrinth defined in a 2-dimensional array (matrix). In addition, while finding the way out, at the same time gold needs to be collected.

1. In this maze, 1s will be considered walls and 0s will be considered paths. The program you will write will try to enter from the upper part and exit from the lower part. The starting point of the labyrinth can be accepted as the (0,0) point and the exit point as the (9,9) point.
2. The labyrinth size will be requested from the user and will be at least 10x10 and maximum 100x100.
3. Maze paths can be arranged as desired.
4. The program must be operable for different labyrinths.
5. There may be a dead end in the maze.
6. There will be monsters in n different locations in the maze. When monsters are reached, the game should start again.
7. There will be m gold in the maze and the collected gold will be counted. At the end of the game, the user will be shown the number of collected gold.
8. All moves made must be recorded in a file.
9. As a result, the output path should be listed as below (page 2) and the output path should be saved to the file.
